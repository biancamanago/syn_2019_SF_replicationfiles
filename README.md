# Groups, Inequality, and Synergy

## Experimental Manipulations
In the experiment, there were two separate conditions. Each condition received a different prompt and also, different instructions and questionnaires throughout the study. The script for the main intervention is available in the **_intervention_** folder.

The questionnaires were part of the manipulation. They are all available in the **_questionnaires_** folder.


## Tasks
Each session, participants interacted on a task. These are the tasks, including the individual forms, group forms, and the expert rankings (for calculation of correctness). All tasks are available in the **_tasks_** folder.
